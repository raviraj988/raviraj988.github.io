## 💼 Professional & Research Summary

I have **4+ years of professional experience** at **Tata Consultancy Services** as a **Machine Learning Engineer** and **Data Engineer**. I designed and deployed full-scale machine learning systems across cloud and on-prem environments in the banking domain. My expertise spans **NLP with BERT/RoBERTa/Longformer**, **CI/CD ML workflows**, and **production monitoring** using Prometheus and Grafana.

My infrastructure work includes building validated ETL pipelines with **Hadoop**, **Snowflake**, **MongoDB**, **DBT**, and **shell scripting**, ensuring secure and high-throughput data delivery.

Alongside industry experience, I’ve conducted **academic research** in areas like:
- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for RAG**
- **Latent Diffusion Models for text-to-image generation**
- **Multimodal Transformers** for image-conditioned text
- **Semi-supervised learning** using deep generative models and ELBO optimization

These experiences reflect my combined strength in both theoretical research and scalable, production-level ML engineering.
