### üíº Professional Experience

**Machine Learning Engineer**  
*Tata Consultancy Services* | Oct 2019 ‚Äì Nov 2023  
Led end-to-end ML pipelines and NLP model development for a banking domain complaint resolution system. Integrated MLflow, Docker, and Kubernetes into scalable MLOps workflows, reducing model deployment times and improving production reliability.

**Data Engineer**  
Designed and maintained secure, high-quality data pipelines using Hive, Snowflake, DBT, and shell scripting.

### üìö Research Highlights

- **Optimizing RAG with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**  
  Modeled RAG as a cooperative RL setup with PPO-trained query, retrieve, and generate agents. Warm-started LoRA adapters improved PPO stability and F1 scores.

- **Multimodal Transformer for Image-Conditioned Generation**  
  Built a SigLIP-Gemma hybrid model with autoregressive decoding, KV caching, and image token prefixing. Achieved a 3.7 BLEU-4 gain over greedy decoding.

- **Latent Diffusion Transformer for Text-to-Image Synthesis**  
  Reproduced Stable Diffusion with classifier-free guidance, achieving FID: 12.4 and CLIPScore: 0.32 on COCO validation. Enabled inpainting, image-to-image, and captioning.

- **Deep Generative Models for Semi-Supervised Learning**  
  Implemented and improved M2 model by Kingma et al. for CIFAR-10 and MNIST, achieving a 4% test accuracy gain with entropy regularization and mutual information techniques.
