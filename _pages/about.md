Hello! I‚Äôm **Ravi Raj Kumar**, a graduate student pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at **Case Western Reserve University**, where I specialize in **Machine Learning**, **Generative AI**, and **AI Infrastructure**. I have four years of professional experience from **Tata Consultancy Services**, where I led the design and deployment of end-to-end machine learning systems in the banking and finance sector. My work included building scalable NLP pipelines using transformer-based models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and Longformer, as well as implementing production-grade MLOps workflows using MLflow, Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins. I‚Äôve handled massive, high-velocity data from sources like Hadoop, Snowflake, and MongoDB, integrating continuous model validation, drift detection, and real-time monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.


### üß™ Research Interests  
My research lies at the intersection of **generative modeling**, **multimodal vision-language learning**, and **reinforcement learning for structured reasoning**. I have explored methods to improve the efficiency, adaptability, and semantic grounding of large models, especially in contexts like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), image-conditioned text generation, and text-to-image synthesis. I am particularly interested in scalable fine-tuning strategies (e.g., LoRA), sample-efficient PPO-based optimization for multi-agent setups, and designing modular generative pipelines that operate across modalities. My work also extends to semi-supervised learning with deep generative models and efficient 3D perception using 2D vision cues‚Äîbridging foundational AI research with practical deployment challenges.


### ü§ñ Robotics  
In robotics, I work on **real-time autonomous systems** integrating perception, planning, and control using **ROS2**, **SLAM**, and behavior trees. I‚Äôve developed multi-robot exploration systems, real-time 3D segmentation pipelines, and motion planning algorithms for quadruped and manipulator platforms. My focus is on combining classical robotics with modern AI techniques to create robust, adaptable, and resource-efficient autonomous systems suitable for deployment in dynamic, unstructured environments.

### üîß Backend & API Development  
I design production-ready backend systems and RESTful APIs using **FastAPI**, **Python**, and containerized microservices. My work follows modern industry practices, including **asynchronous I/O**, **secure secret management**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and **infrastructure-as-code**. I specialize in integrating ML models into scalable APIs, building modular, testable services with versioned deployments, and delivering interactive web interfaces using **Streamlit**, **Gradio**, or **AJAX-based frontends**.
