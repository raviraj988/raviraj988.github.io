Hello! I‚Äôm **Ravi Raj Kumar**, a graduate student pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at **Case Western Reserve University**, with a strong focus on **Machine Learning**, **Generative AI**, and **AI Infrastructure**. With over 4 years of professional experience at **Tata Consultancy Services**, I‚Äôve led end-to-end deployment of production-grade AI systems, including scalable ML pipelines, NLP model development, and MLOps integration.

My academic and research interests center around **vision and Language multimodal systems**, **diffusion models**,**Reinforcement Learning**. I also explore real-time AI applications in robotics and embedded systems.

### üìö Research Highlights

- **Optimizing RAG with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**  
  Developed PPO-optimized agents for query rewrite, passage retrieval, and answer generation, using warm-started LoRA adapters and unified F1 reward shaping.

- **Multimodal Transformer for Image-Conditioned Generation**  
  Engineered a SigLIP-Gemma transformer with autoregressive decoding and KV caching, improving BLEU-4 by +3.7 over greedy decoding.

- **Latent Diffusion for Text-to-Image Synthesis**  
  Reproduced Stable Diffusion v1.5 with classifier-free guidance, achieving FID: 12.4 and CLIPScore: 0.32; enabled inpainting, image-to-image, and captioning tasks.

- **Semi-Supervised Learning with Deep Generative Models**  
  Extended the M2 architecture with entropy regularization and mutual information maximization, yielding a +4% accuracy gain on MNIST.
