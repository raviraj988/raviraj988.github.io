I‚Äôm Ravi Raj Kumar, a graduate student in Computer Science at **Case Western Reserve University**, specializing in AI and Machine Learning. 

I have taken graduate-level courses in **Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing**, **Probabilistic Graphical Models**, **Computer Vision**, **High-Performance Systems for AI**, and **Reinforcement Learning**, which have built a strong foundation for both my academic research and applied AI work.

I have four years of professional experience from **Tata Consultancy Services**, where I worked on designing and deployment of end-to-end machine learning systems in the banking and finance sector.

My work included building and fine-tuning scalable varous NLP pipelines using transformer-based models such as BERT, RoBERTa  as well as implementing production-grade** MLOps workflows** using MLflow, Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins. I‚Äôve handled massive, high-velocity data from sources like Hadoop, Snowflake, and MongoDB, integrating continuous model validation, drift detection, and real-time monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.

## AI & Machine Learning
### üß™ Research Interests  
My research lies at the intersection of **generative modeling**, **multimodal vision-language learning**, and **reinforcement learning for structured reasoning**. I have explored methods to improve sample-efficient PPO-based optimization for multi-agent setups, and designing modular generative pipelines that operate across modalities. My work also extends to semi-supervised learning with deep generative models and efficient 3D perception using 2D vision cues‚Äîbridging foundational AI research with practical deployment challenges.

#### üìö Research Highlights

- **Optimizing RAG with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**  
  Designed a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework for RAG, modeling query design, document retrieval, and answer generation as cooperative agents jointly optimized via PPO under a unified F1-based reward signal.
  
- **Multimodal Transformer for Image-Conditioned Generation**  
  Designed and implemented a multimodal transformer integrating a SigLIP-style Vision Transformer with a Gemma-based causal decoder for image-grounded generation tasks such as captioning and visual question answering.

- **Latent Diffusion for Text-to-Image Synthesis**  
  Reproduced Stable Diffusion v1.5 with classifier-free guidance, achieving FID: 12.4 and CLIPScore: 0.32; enabled inpainting, image-to-image, and captioning tasks.

- **Semi-Supervised Learning with Deep Generative Models**  
  Extended the M2 architecture with entropy regularization and mutual information maximization, yielding a +4% accuracy gain on CIFAR-10 benchmarks.
  
- **üõ∞Ô∏è 3D Point Cloud Segmentation via 2D Voting**  
  Developed a novel 3D point cloud segmentation framework leveraging state-of-the-art 2D image segmentation models (OneFormer) and a voting-based approach to project 2D semantic and panoptic labels onto 3D point clouds, achieving real-time segmentation with reduced computational overhead.
